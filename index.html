		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p style="color:black;">Hi everyone! My name is Sydney Albert and I am a sophomore at the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/"> University of Wisconsin-Madison.</a> I am currently in the School of Journalism and Mass Communications, and I plan on receiving my Digital Media Certficate and my Sports Communication Certificate. I am a huge sports fan, and the intersection between media and sports fascinates me. I am a health guru and enjoy all things working out, cooking healthy meals, and baking treats that agree with my stomach. I am from Closter, New Jersey which is about 20 minutes outside of New York City. In my free time I enjoy hanging out with my family and friends, hiking, working out and going to sporting events.</p>

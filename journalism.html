		<p style="color:black;">I am in the <a href="https://journalism.wisc.edu"> <b> Journalism School</b> </a> at UW Madison. I became interested in Journalism because it runs in my family. My father is a sports broadcaster and my sister is a productions editor for the National Hockey League. I began writing for my high school newspaper freshman year, and I fell in love with the subject area since that moment. I am now studying Strategic Communications within the Journalism school and plan to work in PR.
